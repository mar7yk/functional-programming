# Task 2

We say that K is a unitary divisor of **n** if, after dividing **n** by K, a number is obtained that has no common prime divisors with K.

Implement a function **commonUnitary**, which finds the number of common unitary divisors of given two positive natural numbers **n1** and **n2**

> Example: (commonUnitary 60 140) -> 3  (common unitary divisors are 4, 5, 20)
